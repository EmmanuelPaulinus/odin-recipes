	  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
	  
	  <ul>
  <li> 2 cups of all-purpose flour </li>
  <li> 3 large eggs </li>
  <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
  <li> Water </li>

</ul>
    
	<h1> Steps </h1>  
	 <p> 
 Sift the flour and salt together in a large bowl or on a clean surface.

Make a well in the center of the flour and crack the eggs into it.

Use a fork to whisk the eggs while gradually mixing in the flour from the sides until a dough starts to form.

Use your hands to knead the dough for about 8-10 minutes or until it becomes smooth and elastic.

If the dough is too dry, add a few drops of water. If it's too sticky, add more flour.

Shape the dough into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap. Let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

After resting, unwrap the dough and flatten it with a rolling pin until it's thin enough to fit through a pasta machine.

Dust the dough with flour and feed it through the pasta machine on the widest setting, then fold it in thirds and pass it through again. Repeat this process several times, gradually reducing the width setting each time, until the desired thickness is reached.

Once the dough is the desired thickness, feed it through the desired pasta cutter on the machine, or cut it into strips by hand.

Sprinkle the pasta with flour to prevent sticking, and let it dry for at least 15 minutes before cooking.

To cook, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and add the pasta. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until it's al dente (firm to the bite).

Drain the pasta and serve with your favorite sauce and toppings.
